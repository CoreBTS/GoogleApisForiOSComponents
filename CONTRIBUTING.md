# Contributing Guidelines

* When opening a pull request, make sure that you've checked "Allow edits from maintainers".
* Each PR should be as focused as possible.
* Do not include unnecessary white space changes in your PR! If someone wants to make a pass standardizing white space project-wide, that can be its own PR. Otherwise, follow the convention of each individual file. If your IDE insists on changing formatting, just don't commit it!
* Do not update .NET targets/versions. I intend to keep the project backwards compatible with legacy Xamarin and .NET6 until April 2025 at least.
* For large changes, open an issue first to discuss it.
